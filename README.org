#+title: SLDTrial

This repository records my initial experience with SDL.
I will be using mainly C++.
It is going to house many C projects as I explore game development, and computer graphics.
I am also learning basic C/C++ tooling like CMake.

I hope this is going to make me a tremendously better programmer - minh-p 5/16/2025
